# 🛳️ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains a complete and well-structured solution to the **Kaggle Titanic competition**, using ensemble learning and feature engineering to predict passenger survival.

## 📘 Overview

The Titanic competition is a classic binary classification challenge designed for newcomers to machine learning. This notebook showcases a "winning-style" approach with:

- Thoughtful feature engineering
- Imputation and categorical encoding
- Model ensembling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Final prediction and submission
